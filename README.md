# Cryptography


Cryptographic algorithms are the fundamental to secure digital communication and data. As 
the technology is vastly moved with the ai and other latest technology, the threat landscape has 
increased. There by, the confidentiality, integrity and availability are protected converting the 
data into unreadable formats and verifying the origins. Encryption, decryption and the digital 
signatures are the techniques that the world of cryptography is used.  In this report we provide 
a comprehensive idea on AES (symmetric key algorithm), RSA (asymmetric key algorithm), 
and SHA-256 (hash function), three widely used cryptographic techniques. We aim to 
understand and evaluate the performance, security and efficiency under different conditions.


Here, their history, design principles, and common use cases , known vulnerabilities and performance characteristics are evaluated.
